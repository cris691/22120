- Snippets with highlights via levenshtein distance search from natural
- Improve search page look
- We need to reload on localhost 22120 if we open with that
- We need to not open other localhosts if we already have one open
- ensure we are getting the page text to index once it is actually loaded (we should call again later, or add mutation observer and update on mutate)
  - then send console message to the controller ({textChanged}), to trigger indexURL again
  - throttle how often this can occur per URL
- add fuzzysort as another search signal
