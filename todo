- get snippets earlier (before rendering in lib server) and use to add to signal
- implement trigram index
- try an exact match on the query term if possible for highlight. first one.
- we could also add signal from the highlighting to just in time alter the order (e.g. 'hell wiki' search brings google search to top rank, but the Hell wikipedia page has more highlight visible)
- Create instant search (or at least instant queries (so search over previous queries -- not results necessarily))
- an error in Full text search can corrupt the index and make it unrecoverable...we need to guard against this
  - this is still happening. sometimes the index is not saved, even on a normal error free restart. unknown why. 
- Improve search page look
- We need to reload on localhost 22120 if we open with that
- We need to not open other localhosts if we already have one open
- ensure we are getting the page text to index once it is actually loaded (we should call again later, or add mutation observer and update on mutate)
  - then send console message to the controller ({textChanged}), to trigger indexURL again
  - throttle how often this can occur per URL
