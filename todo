- switch to a new query term highlighter in search result / title and url. Nat works OK for short documents (title, url), but fucks up sometimes for long ones.
- Create instant search (or at least instant queries (so search over previous queries -- not results necessarily))
- an error in Full text search can corrupt the index and make it unrecoverable...we need to guard against this
- Improve search page look
- We need to reload on localhost 22120 if we open with that
- We need to not open other localhosts if we already have one open
- ensure we are getting the page text to index once it is actually loaded (we should call again later, or add mutation observer and update on mutate)
  - then send console message to the controller ({textChanged}), to trigger indexURL again
  - throttle how often this can occur per URL
