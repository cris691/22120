- fix ndx _vacuumIndex to use stack (for scalability)
  - ndx seems to be having problems (particularly if we are restarting)
  - incomplete writes or nodemon restarts seems to be creating an issue for ndx
  - this is not great for a signal of stability
- add fuzzysort as another search signal (but maybe just for queries?)
  - maybe merge all outstanding PRs for fuzzy into fuzzy since it hasn't been maintained since 2018
  - it seems to have some perf issues (CPU hanging, this is not acceptable). 
  - i should experiment more, but also look around for another library.
- combine all search signals
- Snippets with highlights via levenshtein distance search from natural
- Improve search page look
- Create instant search (or at least instant queries (so search over previous queries -- not results necessarily))
- We need to reload on localhost 22120 if we open with that
- We need to not open other localhosts if we already have one open
- ensure we are getting the page text to index once it is actually loaded (we should call again later, or add mutation observer and update on mutate)
  - then send console message to the controller ({textChanged}), to trigger indexURL again
  - throttle how often this can occur per URL
