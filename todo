- provide results page
- We need to reload on localhost 22120 if we open with that
- ensure we are getting the page text to index once it is actually loaded (we should call again later, or add mutation observer and update on mutate)
  - then send console message to the controller ({textChanged}), to trigger indexURL again
  - throttle how often this can occur per URL
- set Id = equal half the size of the index (as its a two way map) on load (so ids don't overwrite)
- add serialize and load to the index (later version of ndx?)
