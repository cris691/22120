- ensure we are correctly indexing / saving the page title when the page title updates.
  - issues. Title still out of date. We are incorrectly connecting to newtab, etc.
- ensure we are getting the page text to index once it is actually loaded (we should call again later, or add mutation observer and update on mutate)
- add export and import of the FTS index
- link up to search input and provide results page
